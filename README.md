# LingmoOS Documentation Site

This is the repo for the [LingmoOS Documentation Site](https://lingmo-documentation.vercel.app/).

This website is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a modern static website generator.

### Local Development

```
$ mkdocs serve
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ mkdocs build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service
