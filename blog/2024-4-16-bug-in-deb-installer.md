Dear Users,

We are reaching out to inform you of a critical issue identified with the package installer that is currently shipped with our system. It has come to our attention that there is a significant bug within the installer which, due to a malfunction, may result in the **unintentional uninstallation of system core components**. This action could lead to the complete corruption of the dependency tree, potentially causing instability or failure of the system.

We deeply apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Our team is fully committed to resolving this issue and ensuring the integrity of our system. However, as we work on a fix, we urge all users to immediately cease using the affected installer to prevent any potential damage to your systems.

Please keep an eye on our official channels for updates and instructions on how to safely update your installer once a fix is available. We understand the importance of trust and reliability, and we are working tirelessly to restore your confidence in our products.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. We apologize again for any disruption this may have caused.

Sincerely,

Elysia
